0004 Openedx-Filters for Close Communication
############################################

Status
******

**Draft**

.. Standard statuses
    - **Draft** if the decision is still preliminary and in experimental phase
    - **Accepted** *(date)* once it is agreed upon
    - **Superseded** *(date)* with a reference to its replacement if a later ADR changes or reverses the decision

Context
*******

As outlined in `ADR-3 <./0003-internal-communication.rst>`__, Django signals provide excellent decoupling of components and we will be extending them to improve tracing/debugging, validation, and holistic system comprehension.

Signals work well in cases where some action simply needs to be triggered at the appropriate time or a system only needs to be notified of an event but does not need to return any sort of response.

There are cases for which signals are a poor fit, such as when a component or action requires a direct response; however, we still want the source of that response data to be be decoupled and highly configurable.

`Openedx-filters <https://github.com/openedx/openedx-filters>`__ is a mechanism being developed to make the edx-platform project more extensible, and specifically to allow configurable functionality that augments, filters, or transforms data at key points in various processes.  It is expressly designed to compliment signals-driven extensions.

There are benefits to using a common foundation as long as it basically serves the need, especially shared development and maintenance burden and portability of knowledge and skills among projects in the ecosystem.

Decision
********

When signals are not feasible for component communication, we will use openedx-filters.

Consequences
************

- Components that communicate relatively directly are more tightly coupled, so when possible try to keep things loose enough to use signal, background tasks, etc.

- Coordinator will be extensible using more-or-less the same mechanisms as edx-platform; experience extending the LMS will transfer to building and extending Commerce Coordinator workflows.

- Openedx-filters defines many filters specific to ``edx-platform`` which are not applicable to Commerce Coordinator; given the `highly modular <./0001-coodinator-design.rst>`__ nature of the Coordinator design, there may not be a similar "single repository" of filter definitions.

- As with signals, we will need to subclass and extend parts of openedx-filters to improve reliability, tracability, validation, and other broad project goals, including:

  - Suppressing the "fail silently" option
  - Adding tracing of pipeline steps
  - Adding validation and other support tooling

  This should *not*, however, change the fundamental design or operation of openedx-filters.
